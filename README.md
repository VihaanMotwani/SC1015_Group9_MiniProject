# Project Title: Predictive Modeling for Food Delivery Times

## Project Overview
The "Predictive Modeling for Food Delivery Times" project aims to harness the power of machine learning to provide accurate predictions for food delivery times. By leveraging historical data on food orders, this project seeks to address common customer pain points regarding uncertain delivery times, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience.

## File Descriptions
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
- `food_order.csv`: Dataset containing order details.
- `SC1015_Group9_MiniProject.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning steps, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, outliers, and correlations between the various features and the target variable.

### Feature Engineering
- Constructed new features that better capture the complexities and nuances of the data, thus providing our models with more information for making accurate predictions.

### Model Building and Evaluation
- Developed multiple regression models and evaluated them, with hyperparameter tuning performed using cross-validation techniques. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

## Results
- A summary of model performance, highlighting the most accurate model and discussing the potential real-world applicability of the predictions.

## Discussion
- Interpretation of results, limitations of the current approach, and potential areas for future research and development to improve prediction accuracy.
